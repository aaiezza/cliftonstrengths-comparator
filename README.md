# What is Clifton Strengths?

GallupÂ® Clifton Strengths is somewhat of a personality test that is commonly used in a professional work environment for the purposes of best understanding the strengths of individuals on a team and assessing where their strengths can be best utilized in an organization.

## The Strengths

Here are the Strengths for which this service will assess an individual. For more information, I highly suggest purchasing your own copy of Clifton Strengths [here](https://store.gallup.com/h/en-us/), or examining the individual strengths on their website [here](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253715/34-cliftonstrengths-themes.aspx).

# Why this "Comparator"

Simply put, I took this assessment in 2018 and once again in 2024 after living through some of the most extreme life-changing events known to a first-world country (_I've been through a lot, but I would never compare my circumstances to those around the world living in **objectively** worse situations_).

I wanted to see how each individual category shifted after both assessments.

## How it works

Create a text file of an ordered list of your 34 strengths after taking the assessment.

For example:

```text
20180205
Achiever
Woo
Communication   
Learner
Activator
         . . .
```

Then, feed them into the program like so:

```shell
java -jar clstcompare.jar -i results1.txt results2.txt -o result_comparison_20241023.txt
``` 

The `result_comparison_20241023.txt` produced from the above example contains a list of a user's strengths ordered by the latest results, and a signed integer identifying its movement between the assessments:

```text
-- 20241023 --

 1. Woo                 +1
 2. Belief              +26
 3. Communication       +0
 4. Achiever            -3
 5. Context             +11
 
         . . .

-- Sorted by movement --

 1. Belief             +26
 2. Restorative        +26
 3. Harmony            +23
 4. Empathy            +18
 5. Responsibility     +13

```


### Future Improvement Ideas

* Allow for multiple assessments to create a timeline of movement among the strengths.
* HTML output for a prettier, interactive result for a user to navigate.

Enjoy!
